How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    When we use diff we can find the difference between two files and then we can compare and get the bugs from our code.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Having a history of our file helps us see our previous versions of the code. and the changes we made to the code.
    And if we encountar any error or want to revert back to previous versions we can easily do that.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    There are many pros while manually choosing to create a commit as it makes us save the versions of our file with our ease
    and makes our lives easier while on the other hand, it's cons are that sometimes we use too much git commits which are unneccessary.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    because whiile working and committing multiple files makes our lives easire.
